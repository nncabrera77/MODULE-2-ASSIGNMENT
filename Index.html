       Love to read, play video games, and hang out with my family on my free time. To stay in physical shape, I enjoy boxing and running about 2 miles a day. Also love to travel and see new places around the world.

        Born in the lehigh valley district of Allentown, Pennsylvania and being going from the cold, leave changing seasons to the bright sunshine state of Florida was something different, but nothing less of great. Living a few miles away from Disney and some of the world's best amusement parks and tourist destination isn't too bad. My family is of hispanic heritage and most of them come from Puerto Rico. Love and enjoy every aspect of my culture from the food, to the dancing, to the the family core traditions, it is truly a huge blessing.
